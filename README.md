# Persistent Data Challenge

Update the guided project from today's class to support editing existing entries. You will need to respond to user taps by populating the student view in a segue preparation method and adapt the current implementation so you can both pass and receive a student record from that detail view controller.

This is very much a thinking exercise and it does not involve much coding. What changes do you need to make? What setup? How do you change the unwind segue to allow model updates? How can you tell the difference between a new record and one that you edited?

Carefully plan and test your changes.
